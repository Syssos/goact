# Goact
Goact is a Go + React based chatting app. Currently this application is at a fetal state, meaning there will be a large amount of work to come.

The current state of the project is where the tutorial from [Tutorial Edge](https://tutorialedge.net/projects/chat-system-in-go-and-react/) leaves off. At its current point, it establishes a connection between the server and client, and elevates it to a web socket.

## Project Plans
Due to the nature of how the project will be worked on it is important to be online and public.

From their the user has access to the chat pool as well as the online status of other user's connected. 

From this point forward the app will be modified for more practical means. I would like to use this space to explain some of the features that will be added over the course of the next couple weeks.

1. Chat control system (Means of controlling which poeple are conversating with eachother, Aka chat rooms)
2. User control system (A method of managing who and how a user interacts with the application, such as accounts protected by passwords)
