# Goact
Goact is a Go + React based chatting app. Currently this application is at a fetal state, meaning there will be a large amount of work to come.

## Project Plans
Due to the nature of how the project will be worked on it is important to be online and public.

I would like to use this space to explain some of the features that will be added over the course of the next couple weeks.

1. Chat control system (Means of controlling which poeple are conversating with eachother, Aka chat rooms)
2. User control system (A method of managing who and how a user interacts with the application)
