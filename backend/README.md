# Goact Backend ![travis-badge](https://app.travis-ci.com/Syssos/goact.svg?branch=main)

This repository holds all of the contents that make up the backend. This can be hosted independently from the front end as it does not host any of the files necessary to access the React app. This works as an independent API and will allow for multiple apps to connect as long as they obtain and send the sign in data to obtain a token.

## Project Documentation

This project is documented on an independant site to allow for more control over design, for any questions it is best to refer to the [docs page](https://docs.codyparal.com/?project=3&category=intro_ga)
