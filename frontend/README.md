# Goact Front End

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It was intended to work as a GUI for users to interact with the backend. This directory can be replicated, changed in style, then reused as another endpoint. Allowing for a fast method to create different styles of chat applications without having to re-write the backend.

Due to React generating the README there was a large amount of data removed, below is a list some of the most useful availalable scripts left in the file.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
